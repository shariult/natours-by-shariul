Layout is done using CSS floats which is compatible with all browsers (even Internet Explorer). 7-1 folder architecture is used with BEM class naming. This website is responsive supporting devices with variety of screen sizes. Advanced CSS features such as Animation, masking, 3d effects etc. is used.
